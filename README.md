# Accessible-Snake-Game

I adapted this game to be accessible with head-pointer and eye-gaze technology.  You can play this game with your built-in keyboard arrow keys or assistive technology.  I implemented the on-screen keys so that a simple hover over them will change direction, enabling the quick movements that Snake required.

I used the [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) library along with a few example from their [website](https://phaser.io/examples) to create this web app.
